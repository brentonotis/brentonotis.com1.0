# brentonotis.com - 1.0

First single page website I haven't completely hated. Gotten to the point where I just need to push the dern thing and tweak/get on with it.

Future implementations I'd like to make happen:

1) updating photos w/ high res./quality headshots
2) having the blocks animate/elevate and spin (or just any kind of animation) when hovered over, possibly w/ pictures updating
3) having '.web developer' text randomly delete itself and replace itself w/ random titles - ideally in sync w/ block hover (similar to the action underneath)
4) make the random text feature remain centered regardless of string size
