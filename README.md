# brentonotis.com - 1.0

First single page website I haven't completely hated. Gotten to the point where I just need to push the dern thing and tweak/get on with it.

Future implementations coming asap:

1) updating photos w/ high res./quality headshots
2) implementing static blog feature/page (and regularly updating)
