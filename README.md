# brentonotis.com - 1.0

First single page website I haven't completely hated. Gotten to the point where I just need to push the dern thing and tweak/get on with it!

Future implementations I'd like to figure out:

1) updating photos w/ high res./quality headshots
2) having the blocks animate/elevate and spin when hovered w/ diff. pictures
3) having '.web developer' text randomly delete itself and replace itself w/ random titles i.e.:'demystifier' - perhaps in sync w/ block hover
4) having an additional sentence underneath photo blocks that behaves similarily to the above scenario. 

If, for some random reason, you stumble across this and have a bunch of free time to waste... feel free to show me the way :)
