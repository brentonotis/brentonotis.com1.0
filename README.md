# brentonotis.com - 1.0

First single page website I haven't completely hated. Gotten to the point where I just need to push the dern thing and tweak/get on with it.

Future implementations coming asap/before launching:

1) updating photos w/ high res./quality headshots
2) implementing static blog feature/page (and regularly updating)
3) ensure optimized for mobile

2.0 wishlist

1) card/image button links animate/do something crazy when clicked
2) integrate some kind of sound(s)/music feature
3) have images on cards change when hovered over (possibly tie this into #2)
4) add projects page (one pager/onto landing - same w/ blog)
